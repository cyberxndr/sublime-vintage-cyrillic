This is a cyrillic-based config for the [Vintage](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html) package. It allows to use vintage with the non-latin layouts. I simple remapped all the latin keys to their cyrillic variants.

Installation
============

**config-based variant**
* Add all the lines from a *cyrillic.sublime-keymap* file to the *Preferences -> [Key Bindings - User]*

**package-based variant**
* Add all the lines from a *cyrillic.sublime-keymap* file to the *sublime-text-2/Packages/Vintage/Default.sublime-keymap* file.

Modification
============

* Remap all the keys in a *translator.py* file
* Run `python translator.py`
* Get your own *cyrillic.sublime-keymap* file
